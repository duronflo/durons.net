Blog Comment Policy

First things first: We love comments and appreciate the time that our readers spend to share ideas and give feedback. 
Thank you to everyone who comments at the Content Marketing Institute.

However, we also want our comments to be as useful as possible to all of our readers. 
While we keep 99% of comments, we will remove these:

 - Harassing comments: While conversation and the sharing of different ideas is encouraged, all comments need to be 
    respectful towards our contributors and those leaving comments.
 - Anonymous comments: We only accept comments from people who identify themselves.
 - Promotional comments: If a comment is solely promotional in nature, we will remove it from the site.

We reserve the right to remove any comments from the site; please leave comments that are respectful and useful.
